Description
===========

ChromePass is a small password recovery tool that allows you to view the
user names and passwords stored by Google Chrome Web browser. For each
password entry, the following information is displayed: Origin URL,
Action URL, User Name Field, Password Field, User Name, Password, and
Created Time. It allows you to get the passwords from your current
running system, or from a user profile stored on external drive.
You can select one or more items and then save them into text/html/xml
file or copy them to the clipboard.

    decrypting the passwords of Chrome 80 or later.

Using ChromePass
================

ChromePass doesn't require any installation process or additional DLL
files. In order to start using ChromePass, simply run the executable file
- ChromePass.exe After running it, the main window will display all
passwords that are currently stored in your Google Chrome browser.



Reading ChromePass passwords from external drive
================================================

Starting from version 1.05, you can also read the passwords stored by
Chrome Web browser from an external profile in your current operating
system or from another external drive (For example: from a dead system
that cannot boot anymore). In order to use this feature, you must know
the last logged-on password used for this profile, because the passwords
are encrypted with the SHA hash of the log-on password, and without that
hash, the passwords cannot be decrypted.
You can use this feature from the UI, by selecting the 'Advanced Options'
in the File menu, or from command-line, by using /external parameter. The
user profile path should be something like "C:\Documents and
Settings\admin" in Windows XP/2003 or "C:\users\myuser" in Windows
10/8/7/Vista/2008.
